 # A study of polarisaton in online (Twitter) social networks
The phenomenon of polarisation is believed to lie at the root of misinformation, whose influence on
societal matters like elections or public policies regarding issues like climate change or the present
pandemic has attracted increasing academic and social attention.
One approach to the study of polarisation is that offered by complex network analysis, the typical
procedure being 1) constructing a graph representation (consisting of nodes and links) of the social
system; 2) determining a partition of such a graph in terms of groups, or clusters, that differ in a
property of interest (such as being in favour or against abortion); and 3) evaluating the polarisation
of the partitioned graph by means of a so-called polarisation measure. Each of these 3 steps (graph
representation, clustering, and evaluation) offer some freedom, and in this project the first and the
last will be fixed. The graph representation will consist of nodes corresponding to crowd-sourced
Twitter elite users (also called influencers in regular language) connected in terms of the overlap of
their respective audiences, and the polarisation measure stems from the axiomatic proposal of [1].
The student will apply the specified strategy to well-known toy problems and to real Twitter data,
exploring the use of different clustering algorithms to determine the more appropriate choice for
evaluating the polarisation of an online social network.
